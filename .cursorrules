# Cursor Rules for First-Game Project

## Local Development Server

This project contains multiple HTML/JavaScript games that need to be served over HTTP for proper testing.

### Server Configuration
- **Port**: 8081
- **Server**: Python3 HTTP server
- **Command**: `python3 -m http.server 8081`

### Testing Protocol

When making changes to any game files or when asked to test functionality:

1. **Check for Running Server**: Before starting a new server, check if one is already running on port 8081 by listing the terminals folder.

2. **Start Server** (if not running): 
   - Run `python3 -m http.server 8081` in a background terminal
   - The server should remain running in the background
   - Games will be accessible at `http://localhost:8081/`

3. **Access Points**:
   - Main menu: `http://localhost:8081/index.html`
   - Minecraft/Slimes game: `http://localhost:8081/minecraft-world/index.html`
   - Zombie game: `http://localhost:8081/zombie/index.html`
   - Fisher game: `http://localhost:8081/fisher/index.html`
   - Goalie game: `http://localhost:8081/goalie/index.html`

4. **Testing Workflow**:
   - After making changes to HTML/JS/CSS files, navigate to the appropriate URL
   - Use browser snapshot to verify the page loaded correctly
   - Interact with game elements to test functionality
   - Check console messages for errors if needed
   - Take screenshots when visual verification is important

5. **When to Test**:
   - After implementing new game features
   - After fixing bugs
   - After making UI/styling changes
   - When explicitly asked to test or verify functionality
   - Before concluding major feature implementations

### Project Structure
- Each game is in its own folder with `index.html` and `main.js`
- Root `index.html` is the game selection menu
- All games use Kaboom.js library

### Common Testing Scenarios
- Game mechanics (movement, collision, scoring)
- UI elements and responsiveness
- Game state management (start, pause, game over)
- Visual effects and animations
- Cross-browser compatibility
