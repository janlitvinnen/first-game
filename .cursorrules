# Game Development Rules

## Testing Protocol
After EVERY code change to the game:
1. Open the index.html file directly in the browser (use file:// protocol or navigate to the file)
2. Take a snapshot of the page to inspect elements and functionality
3. Test all interactive features that were modified or could be affected
4. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors or warnings
5. Verify the game renders correctly and behaves as expected

## Error Detection and Fixing
If ANY errors are detected during testing:
- Console errors (JavaScript runtime errors)
- Visual rendering issues
- Broken game mechanics or interactions
- Performance problems
- Any unexpected behavior

Then IMMEDIATELY:
1. Identify the root cause of the error
2. Fix the issue in the code
3. Re-test in the browser to verify the fix
4. Continue this cycle until no errors remain

## Quality Standards
- All game features must work correctly in the browser
- No console errors or warnings should be present
- The game should be playable without issues
- User interactions should respond as expected
- Visual elements should render properly

## Workflow
Never consider a task complete until:
- The game has been tested in the browser
- All features work correctly
- No errors are present in the console
- The gameplay experience is smooth and bug-free

Always use the browser testing tools to validate changes before moving on to the next task.
